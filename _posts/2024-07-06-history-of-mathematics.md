## History of Mathematics

Mathematics has a rich and extensive history that spans various cultures and centuries. Here are some key milestones and contributions from different periods and regions:

### Ancient Civilizations

#### Mesopotamia
- **Babylonians**: Developed early forms of arithmetic and geometry. Known for their base-60 number system, which influenced our current time-keeping system (60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour).
- **Sumerians**: Created one of the earliest counting systems, which used a combination of base-10 and base-60.

#### Egypt
- **Egyptians**: Utilized mathematics for building pyramids and other architectural feats. They had an understanding of geometry and used a decimal system for counting.

#### Greece
- **Pythagoras**: Known for the Pythagorean theorem in geometry.
- **Euclid**: Often referred to as the "Father of Geometry," his work "Elements" is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics.
- **Archimedes**: Made significant contributions to geometry, calculus, and understanding the concept of infinity.

### Middle Ages

#### Islamic Golden Age
- **Al-Khwarizmi**: His works introduced the concepts of algebra. The term "algorithm" is derived from his name.
- **Omar Khayyam**: Made advancements in algebra and worked on the classification and solution of cubic equations.
- **Al-Kindi**: Known for his work on cryptography and frequency analysis.

### Renaissance

#### Europe
- **Leonardo Fibonacci**: Introduced the Fibonacci sequence to Western mathematics through his book "Liber Abaci."
- **René Descartes**: Developed Cartesian geometry, which uses algebra to describe geometry.
- **Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz**: Independently developed calculus, a major advancement in mathematics.

### Modern Era

#### 18th and 19th Centuries
- **Carl Friedrich Gauss**: Made contributions to number theory, algebra, statistics, analysis, and differential geometry.
- **Sophie Germain**: Worked on number theory and elasticity theory.
- **Évariste Galois**: Founded group theory and provided a solution to the problem of solvability of polynomial equations.

#### 20th Century to Present
- **Alan Turing**: Laid the foundations of computer science and artificial intelligence.
- **John von Neumann**: Contributed to set theory, functional analysis, quantum mechanics, and computer science.
- **Andrew Wiles**: Proved Fermat's Last Theorem, which was one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics.
