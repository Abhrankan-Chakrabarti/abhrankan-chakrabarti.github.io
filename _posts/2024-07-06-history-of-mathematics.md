## History of Mathematics

Mathematics, the abstract science of number, quantity, and space, has a rich and fascinating history. Here are some key milestones and contributions from different periods:

### Ancient and Classical Periods

#### Early Mathematics
- **Egyptian Mathematics**: The ancient Egyptians developed a decimal system and were known for their knowledge of geometry, which they used in constructing pyramids.
- **Babylonian Mathematics**: Known for their development of a base-60 number system and early work in algebra and geometry.

### Greek Mathematics
- **Pythagoras**: Best known for the Pythagorean theorem, which relates the sides of a right triangle.
- **Euclid**: Often referred to as the "father of geometry," Euclid's work "Elements" is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics.

### Medieval and Renaissance Mathematics

#### Islamic Mathematics
- **Al-Khwarizmi**: His works on algebra (from which the term "algorithm" is derived) were fundamental to the development of this branch of mathematics.
- **Omar Khayyam**: Known for his work on the classification and solution of cubic equations.

### European Renaissance
- **Leonardo Fibonacci**: Introduced the Fibonacci sequence to the Western world through his book "Liber Abaci."
- **Ren√© Descartes**: Developed Cartesian coordinates, bridging algebra and Euclidean geometry.

### Modern Mathematics

#### 17th and 18th Centuries
- **Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz**: Independently developed calculus, a branch of mathematics that deals with continuous change.
- **Leonhard Euler**: Made pioneering contributions to topology and introduced much of the modern terminology and notation, including the concept of a function.

### 19th and 20th Centuries
- **Carl Friedrich Gauss**: Known as the "Prince of Mathematicians," Gauss made significant contributions to number theory, algebra, statistics, analysis, differential geometry, and electrostatics.
- **David Hilbert**: Proposed the famous list of 23 unsolved problems at the start of the 20th century, which guided much of the research in mathematics.
